today I solved another CTF of  VladMetz from crackmes.one
https://crackmes.one/crackme/61f588f033c5d413767ca782
I used IDA and x64dbg to understand the code and them wrote some python code to generate the password
IMPORTANT:
The complexity of the code is not the greatest, but I had to run the code only one time to get the
password.
